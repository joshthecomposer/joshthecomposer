# Welcome, This is my journey!

## About me:

My name is Joshua Wise, and I am a musician, sound designer, and software developer based in New York City. My current career is actually pretty exciting! I write music for various media, and my music as even been on TV! However, I fell in love with coding when I dipped my toes in the world of dynamic videogame music using FMODâ€”a C++-based middleware used for implementing dynamic music and audio. 

After awakening my interest in coding, I began toying with Python, JavaScript, and C#. But I decided I needed to take my journey a step further, and I decided to hone my skills through a more structured program such as coding bootcamp. I setteled with the Full Stack Python course at Coding Dojo, and I've since finished, having learned a great deal about SOLID principles and OOP which have kickstarted my foundation in programming.

## My goals:

My ultimate goal is to *eventually* get back into the music space, but as a software developer. I would love to work at a company creating VST instruments, Software Audio plugins, or DAWs. However, I am interested in working in a non-music environment for many years before this so that my skills can be brought to the highest level. I have these broad goals in mind as I continue my learning post-bootcamp and while applying to jobs.

* Add more proficiency in C# through learning techs like Blazor.
* Develop my intuition through repetition and practice with algorithm problems, both at Coding Dojo but also through sites such as CodeWars.
* Develop a 3-5 solid portfolio projects that enhance someone's life in some meaningful way.
* Begin my career as a software developer.
* Always learn new things, and always practice music. Yes, music is still very important XD.
