## Hello There!

My name is Joshua Wise, and I am a software developer and composer. I write music for various media, and my music as even been on TV! However, I fell in love with coding when I dipped my toes in the world of dynamic videogame music using FMODâ€”a middleware used for implementing procedural music and audio. 

I am currently a Data Engineer at ParentSquare, and I currently build things in Rust in my free time.
