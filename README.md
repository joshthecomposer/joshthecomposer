# Welcome, This is My Coding Journey!

## About me:

My name is Joshua Wise, and I am a musician, sound designer, and software developer based in New York City. My current career is actually pretty exciting! I write music for various media, and my music as even been on TV! However, I fell in love with coding when I dipped my toes in the world of dynamic videogame music using FMODâ€”a C++-based middleware used for implementing dynamic music and audio. 

After awakening my interest in coding, I began toying with Python, JavaScript, and C#. But I decided I needed to take my journey a step further, and I decided to hone my skills through a more structured program such as coding bootcamp. I settled on the 3 Full Stack course at Coding Dojo, and I'm loving my progress so far!

## My goals:

My ultimate goal is to get back in the music space, but as a software developer. I would love to work at a company creating VST instruments, Software Audio plugins, or even DAWs. However, I am interested in working in a non-music environment for many years before this so that my skills can be brought to the highest level. The first step is to complete my study at Coding Dojo, and by doing so I will have completed the following goals:

* Become proficient in Python, Java, JavaScript, and C#.
* Develop my intuition through repetition and practice with algorithm problems, both at Coding Dojo but also through sites such as CodeWars.
* Develop a 3-5 solid portfolio projects that enhance my own life in some meaningful way.
* Take my knowledge and begin my application process to companies that I like.
* Begin my career as a software developer.
* Always learn new things, and always practice music. Yes, music is still very important XD.
