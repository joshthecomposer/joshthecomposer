## Hello There!

My name is Joshua Wise, and I am a software developer and composer based in New York City. Currently, I write music for various media, and my music as even been on TV! However, I fell in love with coding when I dipped my toes in the world of dynamic videogame music using FMODâ€”a middleware used for implementing procedural music and audio. 

Now I've fully committed to software dev, with the longterm goal of getting into DAW and Audio DSP software, but for now I love making fullstack apps with things like ASP.Net Core, React, and Python.
